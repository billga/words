<title>Introduction</title>
<table><tr><td>This e-text in HTML is derived from the original file 
bible11.zip which contains a single text file of the entire 
King James Version Bible.  The text in bible11.zip was typeset 
beautifully by the Project Gutenberg and released on Easter 1992.
<tr><td>
<tr><td>I took the Project Gutenberg Version, split it into individual
books, and converted each book to HTML format by a mostly automated
procedure.  For a visually pleasing display of the e-text, the reader would need 
a browser that supports table layout.
<tr><td>
<tr><td>I wish to thank Derek Andrew of the Project Gutenberg
who graciously gave his consent for this HTML Version to be put into the
public domain.
<tr><td>
<tr><td>This e-text is thus put into the public domain with the fond hope
that it will spread the Gospel to all people and that people
might come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour.</table>
