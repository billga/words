This e-text in HTML is derived from the original file bible11.zip
which contains a single text file of the entire King James Version Bible. 
The text in bible11.zip was typeset beautifully by the Project Gutenberg 
and released on Easter 1992.

I took the Project Gutenberg Version, split it into individual books, and 
converted each book to HTML format by a mostly automated procedure. 
For a visually pleasing display of the e-text, the reader would need 
a browser that supports table layout.

I wish to thank Derek Andrew of the Project Gutenberg who graciously 
gave his consent for this HTML Version to be put into the public domain.

Please read the Free Public License associated with this e-text which is 
in the file _license.htm.

This e-text is thus put into the public domain with the fond hope
that it will spread the Gospel to all people and that people
might come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour.
