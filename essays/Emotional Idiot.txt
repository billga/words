I'm an emotional idiot so get away from me 
i mean, come here 
wait, no, that's too close 
give me some space 
it's a big country 
there's plenty of room 
don't sit so close to me 
hey, where are you? 
i haven't seen you in days 
what are you having an affair? 
who is she? 
come on, aren't I enough for you? 
god, you're so cold 
I never know what you're thinking 
you're not very affectionate 
I mean, you're clinging to me 
don't touch me 
what am I your fucking cat? 
don't rub me like that 
don't you have anything better to do 
than sit there fawning over me? 
don't you have any interests, hobbies 
sailing fly-fishing archeology? 
there's an archeology expedition leaving tomorrow 
why don't you go? 
I'll loan you the money 
my money is your money 
my life is yours 
my soul is yours 
without you i'm nothing 
move in with me 
we'll get a studio apartment together save on rent 
well wait I mean maybe a one bedroom 
so we don't get in each other's hair or anything or 
actually maybe a two bedroom 
i'll have my own bedroom 
it's nothing personal 
i just need to be alone sometimes 
you do understand don't you? 
hey why are you acting distant? 
where are you going? 
was it something I said? 
what? 
what did I do? 
I'm an emotional idiot so get away from me 
I mean 
Marry Me!
