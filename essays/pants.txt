Why do rich people pants always lose money?
I lost 75 cents tonight in the theater.
Hippy pants the p[ockets go all the way back to your ass
so you can sit on your money and keep track of it.
I end up having to pay for them each time I wear them
not only that, but I can't wash them, I have to dry clean and that
costs money.
