The Patience Sutra
	Mike Romoth

Come on!
Let's steal a car and drive to the mountains
Let's do it!  Right now!
We'll buy a bottle of wine and sit on a railroad bridge and sing songs to the moon
We'll find a fuse and we'll set it on fire
Come on! Right Now! Let's go! Let's go!
Coffee cigarettes whiskey sex
Let's eat everything that makes us crazy
Come on! We've got to go!
We can't wait even a minute more, tonight is the end of the world
So let's dodge this catatonia that sings us into dangerous sleep
We can sleep when we're dead
We can diet when famine rolls into town
Enough of this comfort and anaesthesia
Enough of insurance car payments love money deadlines
Can't you see the beautiful body you've been assigned
Don't you want to test it?!
Run it like a race car!
Let's go! Let's go! Right now!
I don't wanna read a book see a movie watch TV
Let's get in a fistfight you and I
Let's go down to the ocean it's not that far away
We'll strip off our clothes there and swim in the icy bitter sea
And if we cut our feet on the rocks, so be it
And if we lose ourselves in the waves, so be it
But let's do it now!  Let's go! Let's go! 
Who here is afraid to explode?
Let's buy a gun, let's break a window!
Let's take our bicycles to the top of the hill and ride down no hands
Cruising through the red lights with our eyes closed
We could all get tattoos I know a place nearby
We could all be on the next ferry to Alaska
Let's do it all!
Come on! Let's go!
